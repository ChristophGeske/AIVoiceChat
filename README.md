# üéôÔ∏è AIVoiceChat ‚Äî Real‚Äëtime Voice Chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT‚Äë5 high (Android)


## üí° What is AIVoiceChat?

When you ever tried OpenAIs "AdvancedVoice" or Googles "Gemini Live" you might have noticed that the quality of the answears is not as good as the Thinking models Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT‚Äë5 Thinking high. 

The reason for that is that when you use the voice option from these companies they use a different model that is optimized for low‚Äëlatency streaming rather than using the long ‚Äúthinking‚Äù mode which gives better answears but can take up to minutes. 

AIVoiceChat talks directly to the stronger text models (Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT‚Äë5 high) so you get the highest possible quality answers with the disadventage of sometimes much slower responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

- Speech‚Äëto‚ÄëText (STT): Uses Android‚Äôs built‚Äëin SpeechRecognizer (US English can be set by you in your phone settings) 
- LLM calls: Use Google and OpenAI servers for generating responses (Should adjust automatically to your spoken language)
- TTS: Android TextToSpeech (US English can be set by you in your phone settings)

SentenceTurnEngine:  
   - Sends a strict instruction so the model returns exactly one sentence in JSON:  
     `{"sentence":"<one concise sentence>","is_final_sentence":true|false}`  
   - Requests the next sentence when the previous one finishes TTS this keeps conversation fast


- STT and TTS quality can vary by device/network settings but might run locally which would make it super fast
- Early alpha: occasional hiccups with streaming, pacing, or rate limits. The choosen sentence-by-sentence generation used is low on tokens but high on requests which for Gemini free tier might be less ideal since Gemini free tier is counting requests and not tokens.


## ü§ù Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. If you have ideas for better streaming, pacing, or UX, please open an issue to discuss. The app is still in Alpha so many improvements are already planed.
