# üéôÔ∏è AIVoiceChat ‚Äî Real‚Äëtime Voice Chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT‚Äë5 (Android)


## üí° What is AIVoiceChat?

When you have tried OpenAI's "Advanced Voice" or Google's "Gemini Live," you might have noticed that the quality of the answers is not as good as the thinking models Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5, which both have higher thinking capabilities than the current voice models.

The reason for that is that when you use the voice option from these companies, they use a different model that is optimized for low-latency streaming rather than using the long ‚Äúthinking‚Äù mode, which gives better answers but can take up to minutes.

AIVoiceChat wants to fix that and allows you to talk directly to the stronger text models (Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5) so you get the highest possible quality answers, with the disadvantage of slower response times. Also, you need to speak very clearly for the speech-to-text model used in your phone to work well. Another disadvantage is that all tone or emotion in your voice is lost and can't be picked up by this voice chat. The advantage is that you get much higher quality answers, and you can modify how the system should respond by simply changing the system prompt and adjusting the settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

- Speech‚Äëto‚ÄëText (STT): Uses Android‚Äôs built‚Äëin SpeechRecognizer (US English can be set by you in your phone settings) 
- LLM calls: Uses Google and OpenAI servers for generating responses (Should adjust automatically to your spoken language)
- TTS: Android TextToSpeech (US English can be set by you in your phone settings)

SentenceTurnEngine:  
   - Sends a strict instruction so the model returns exactly one sentence in JSON:  
     `{"sentence":"<one concise sentence>","is_final_sentence":true|false}`  
   - Requests the next sentence when the previous one finishes TTS, this keeps conversation fast


- STT and TTS quality can vary by device/network settings but might run locally which would make it super fast
- Early alpha: occasional hiccups with streaming, pacing, or rate limits. The chosen sentence-by-sentence generation used is low on tokens but high on requests which for Gemini free tier might be less ideal since Gemini free tier is counting requests and not tokens.


## ü§ù Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. If you have ideas for better streaming, pacing, or UX, please open an issue to discuss. The app is still in Alpha so many improvements are already planned.
